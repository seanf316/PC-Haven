                <h2 id="intellectual-property-rights">Intellectual property rights</h2>
                <p>&#8220;Intellectual Property Rights&#8221; means all present and future rights conferred by statute,
                    common law or equity in or in relation to any copyright and related rights, trademarks, designs,
                    patents, inventions, goodwill and the right to sue for passing off, rights to inventions, rights to
                    use, and all other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and
                    including all applications and rights to apply for and be granted, rights to claim priority from,
                    such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection and any other results of
                    intellectual activity which subsist or will subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.
                    This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual property owned by the Operator or third
                    parties, and all rights, titles, and interests in and to such property will remain (as between the
                    parties) solely with the Operator. All trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in
                    connection with the Website and Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Operator or
                    its licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the
                    Website and Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of the Website and
                    Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any of the Operator or third

                <h2 id="severability">Severability</h2>
                <p>All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and
                    binding only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be
                    limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or
                    unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be
                    illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the
                    parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with
                    respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall
                    remain in full force and effect.</p>
                <h2 id="dispute-resolution">Dispute resolution</h2>
                <p>The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and any disputes arising out of it
                    shall be governed by the substantive and procedural laws of Ireland without regard to its rules on
                    conflicts or choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of Ireland. The exclusive
                    jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts located
                    in Ireland, and you hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. You hereby waive any
                    right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The United
                    Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this
                    Agreement.</p>
